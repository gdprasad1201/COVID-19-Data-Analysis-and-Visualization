# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization (In Progress)

## Introduction
This project is about analyzing and visualizing the COVID-19 data using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. The data is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subho117/covid-19-analysis-and-visualization).

The COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization project focuses on conducting an in-depth analysis of large-scale COVID-19 datasets sourced from Kaggle, comprising over 200,000 rows of data. The primary objective is to uncover actionable insights and trends related to COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and testing. Utilizing advanced Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Sklearn, I performed comprehensive data analysis, including cleaning, processing, and validating the datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability. I developed and trained a high-performing machine learning model using Sklearn's polynomial regression (degree 2), achieving an impressive R-squared score of 83%, which enables accurate forecasting of COVID-19 recoveries based on confirmed case data. Additionally, I designed and implemented interactive map visualizations and dynamic timelines using Plotly and WordCloud, effectively showcasing the progression of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths across 45+ countries. These visualizations facilitate data-driven decision-making by highlighting significant patterns and trends in the data. This project demonstrates the power of data analytics and machine learning in understanding and responding to global health crises, providing valuable insights for public health officials and policymakers to make informed decisions.
